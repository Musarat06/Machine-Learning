# Machine Learning: Predicting Bike Sharing Rental Count

This repository contains a project focused on predicting bike sharing rental counts using Decision Tree and Logistic Regression models.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build machine learning models to predict the number of bike rentals based on various features. The models used in this project are:
- Decision Tree
- Logistic Regression

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains various features that influence bike rental counts, such as weather conditions, date, and time. The data preprocessing and feature engineering steps are documented in the Jupyter Notebooks..
